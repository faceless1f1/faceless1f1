I’m interested in Data Science, Cybersecurity, Electronics, Mathematics, and Quantum Physics. My
main focus is on Cybersecurity, specifically on the offensive side of cybersecurity. I love learning
how things work in their most basic form. I'm currently in my freshmen year of college at the University
of Hartford as a Data Science Major on the CS/Mathematics Path. My current main language is Python.
However, I have an Intro to Computing course which means I have to learn Java too. The other languages
I am learning near the same are x86-64 assembly, C, and Bash. I'm also dabbling in Go. I'm really enjoying
writing code in Python and clawing my eyes out debugging C.
