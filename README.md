I’m interested in Data Science, Cybersecurity, Electronics, Mathematics, Cryptography and Quantum Physics.
My main focus is on Cybersecurity, specifically on the offensive side of cybersecurity. I love learning
how things work in their most basic form. I'm currently in my freshmen year of college at the University
of Hartford as a Data Science Major on the CS/Mathematics Path. My current main language is Python and C.
However, I have an Intro to Computing course which means I have to learn Java too. The other languages
I am learning near the same are x86-64 assembly and Bash. I'm also dabbling in Go. I'm really enjoying
writing code in Python and clawing my eyes out debugging C.

If I had to audit my skills these would be my grades in my opinion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A+ = "Anything you throw at me, I can do and do it well"
A = "Anything you throw at me, I can do"
B = "I have a decent amount of knowledge on the subject"
C = "I have enough knowledge to fend for myself but definitely not enough for some tasks"
D = "I can figure things out basic things by myself and need assistance for anything beyond that"
F = "I cannot figure things out"
